Hi, I am Purvam Pujari, a Computer Science Graduate student at University of Southern California (USC). I love problem solving, and hence I have been involved in developing solutions to address real-world problems using software development. Recently, I have been fascinated with Artifical Intelligence and hope to dive deeper into it.

I have done my Undergrad in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai. I hope to realise my long-term career goal of building truly intelligent programs for humanity.

" A year spent in programming is enough to make one believe in God ! "

Apart from these, I like game designing and swimming, and I also enjoy night journeys. Moreover, I have been intrigue with Space-time theories and love exploring it.
